# Tweet-reGenerator with Node.js

## Challenge

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you…

  - Can build basic CRUD apps with Node.js and a SQL database
  - Have a Twitter account and are familiar with basic Twitter concepts (like re-tweeting)
  - Are interested in building full-stack web applications with frameworks like Express
  - Are interested in using a live web API

## Context
The life-span for a tweet is about 20 minutes, which means that most of your Twitter followers will not see your tweets the first time you post them. For this reason, re-tweeting your best content is a good idea.

This web app will allow you to grab and store your best, evergreen content tweets and re-tweet them to your followers. By keeping your Twitter followers better informed and entertained, you will organically grow your Twitter audience faster.

Developers/Learners will get practice working with Twitter’s REST APIs on the backend; and with creating and working with a database on the backend (CRUD).
