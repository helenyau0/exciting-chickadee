# Tweet-reGenerator with Node.js

## Context
The life-span for a tweet is about 20 minutes, which means that most of your Twitter followers will not see your tweets the first time you post them. For this reason, re-tweeting your best content is a good idea.

This web app will allow you to grab and store your best, evergreen content tweets and re-tweet them to your followers. By keeping your Twitter followers better informed and entertained, you will organically grow your Twitter audience faster.
